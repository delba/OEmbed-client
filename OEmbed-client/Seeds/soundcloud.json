But even here, in the Techno realm, Oliver Koletzki demonstrates his inimitable sense for melody: thus, the gloomy and driving framework of 'Iyewaye' is lit up by a crystal-clear synth-sequence. Similarly, 'Ipuza', which hypnotizes by way of reduction and repetition, is funky in its core thanks to a rolling tribal groove. Functional, but with heart and soul.  \n\n\u279f Homepage: www.stilvortalent.de \n\u279f Facebook: facebook.de/stilvortalent\n\u279f Soundcloud: @stilvortalent\n\u279f Youtube: youtube.com/stilvortalenttv\n\u279f Online-Shop: www.stilvortalent.bigcartel.com/\n\u279f Twitter: twitter.com/_StilvorTalent\n\u279f Instagram: instagram.com/stilvortalentmusic","thumbnail_url":"http://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000110341608-rj6284-t500x500.jpg","html":"\u003Ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true\u0026url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F196338620\u0026show_artwork=true\"\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E","author_name":"Stil vor Talent","author_url":"http://soundcloud.com/stilvortalent"}
